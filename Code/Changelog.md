## v.0.2.11.1

- fixed crash when connecting or drawing bike-only path through a roundabout (Left-hand traffic maps only)
- minor compatibility improvements to force-unsafe lane connections on custom-made roads

Note regarding the inability to connect bike lanes or the lack of bike connections at intersections: neither the vanilla, nor the mod (reusing vanilla code) supports networks that combine highway lanes and bike lanes on a single road section (without a median/splitting lane). I haven't found any reliable solution yet.
