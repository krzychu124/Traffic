## v.0.2.7

_Compatibility fix for the game update 1.2.5f1_

- Improved validation logic for more accurate detection of edge cases and handling missing or broken road/track network data
- Mod data integrity validation is now running after every save game load
- Fixed errors and potential game crash when using the PDX Launcher "Resume", still not recommending use of that feature since save game stored data cannot be loaded correctly in that mode (save reload is required),
- Fixed potential problem with empty language list after unchecking "Use Game Language" checkbox
